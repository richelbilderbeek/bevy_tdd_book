# Introduction

Welcome to this book!
This book is called 'Developing Bevy games using TDD'.
The goal of this book is to demonstrate how to do Test-Driven Development
with Bevy.

This introductory chapter describes the ideas behind this book.
If you want to dive right in, go to the next chapter now!

## Why this book?

This book started from the question: 'Is Bevy suitable for Test-Driven Development?',
as the author was looking for a Rust gaming library
suitable for Test-Driven Development.

At the time of writing, there is only one [blog post on Test-Driven Development with Bevy](https://edgardocarreras.com/blog/tdd-in-rust-game-engine-bevy/),
which only has two tests. And that test suite has not been
built up from scratch.

This book tries to start from scratch and build up gradually,
always aiming for 100% code coverage.

When all facets of a game can be tested with 100% code coverage,
the question 'Is Bevy suitable for Test-Driven Development?'
can be answered with a 'yes'.

## What is the intended audience of this book?

This book is suitable for intermediate Rust developers: people that have read parts of
'The Rust programming language' `[Klabnik & Nichols, 2018]``[Klabnik & Nichols, 2023]`
and are able to write functions and structures.

This book does not teach Rust, nor Bevy.
Instead, it shows Test-Driven Development in Rust with Bevy.

## What is the goal of this book?

The goal is to demonstrate how to do Test-Driven Development
in Rust with Bevy.

Each chapter introduces as much new concepts as needed,
which is as few as possible.
Due to this, the first chapters do not result in a playable game yet.

## How to read this book?

Start at chapter 1 and then move
forwards chronologically,
as the book introduces concepts one at a time.
However, using this book as a reference for code snippets will
probably work out fine too.
