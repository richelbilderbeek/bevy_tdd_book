# Move a camera

This chapter shows how to move a camera.

The idea is to give a camera a velocity,
making the camera move on screen.

## Conclusion

We can now create an `App` with a camera that moves.
When running the `App`, we can see the camera moves.
We have tested everything that the App does!
