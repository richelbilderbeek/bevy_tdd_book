First test: an empty <code>App</code> has no players","text":"<p>First, we test that there are zero players in an empty <code>App</code>. We could call the function <code>count_number_of_players</code>. However, it is all too common to abbreviate 'number of' by an <code>n</code>, resulting in the function name <code>count_n_players</code>:</p> <pre><code>fn test_empty_app_has_no_players() {\n    let app = App::new(); // Note 1: Need mut later\n    app.update(); // Note 2: always update before testing\n    assert_eq!(count_n_players(&amp;app), 0);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The error will be that the <code>count_n_players</code> function is absent.</p> <p>The comment <code>Note 1</code> is to foreshadow that an <code>App</code> needs to be mutable to have its amount of players counted. It is unexpected that a read-only operation (i.e. counting the amount of players) requires the data it works on to be mutable. The Bevy library, however, has good reasons why <code>App</code> must be mutable: also reading data need to be done in a safe way.</p> <p>In general, a read-only operation should be able to work on an immutable data structure: when, for example, getting the name of a person structure (a read-only operation), we do not expect the person to change and we expect to be able to do so on an immutable person. Correct use the Rust keyword <code>mut</code> is what I call <code>mut</code>-correctness, which is similar to C++ const correctness, where the C++ <code>const</code> keyword indicates something immutable. In C++, it is recommended to be const correct <code>[C++ FAQ][Cline et al., 1998][Eckel, 2000][Lakos, 1996][Sutter, 2004]</code>. As there is no reason why Rust would be different in this regard, this book strives to be <code>mut</code>-correct (and please, contact me if you can share a <code>mut</code>-correct implementation of <code>count_n_players</code>).</p> <p>The comment <code>Note 2</code> is to remind us to always call <code>app.update()</code> before testing. An <code>app.update()</code> lets Bevy initialize an <code>App</code> and it will give false results to do tests on uninitialized <code>App</code>s. Maybe this test will pass without initialization, but it would be an improperly conducted test.</p> <p>To put <code>app.update()</code> at the end of the <code>create_app</code> function is a good idea in some contexts, as it means we do not need to call <code>app.update()</code> in each test. A drawback of calling <code>app.update()</code> in a <code>create_app</code> function is that it does finalize the creation of our <code>App</code>: we cannot -for example- add another player to our created <code>App</code>. The decision strategy in this book is, that if <code>app.update()</code> can be put in <code>create_app</code>, it is put there.</p>","tags":["chapter","add","player"]},{"location":"chapters/add_player/#232-first-fix","title":"2.3.2.

This 'something' is typically a function.</p> <p>The word 'Startup' is the name of a so-called schedule, i.e. it indicates when the system should be run. In our case, the system should be run at startup.</p> <p>Our <code>create_app</code> functions adds a system, called <code>add_player</code>, that is run at the startup phase of the application, then returns our <code>App</code>.</p> <p>Here is the <code>add_player</code> function:</p> <pre><code>fn add_player(mut commands: Commands) {\n    commands.spawn(Player);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This function has some magic to it:</p> <ul> <li><code>mut commands: Commands</code>: this function argument is provided by Bevy.

One could argue that it is harder to understand what this does, where the function name <code>add_player</code> was communicated this clearly. One could argue that the expression is more complex, as it introduces a closure (more on those later). This book picked the way that is easier to explain. This approach also scales better when adding players, enemies, cameras, etcetera.</p> <pre><code>fn count_n_players(app: &amp;mut App) -&gt; usize {\n    let mut query = app.world_mut().query::&lt;&amp;Player&gt;();\n    query.iter(app.world()).len()\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This implementation is a simple way to count the amount of <code>Player</code> components. Here I break down the implementation:</p> <ul> <li><code>let mut query</code>: we create a question to ask to Bevy.   In the context of informatics, a question such as this is called 'a query'.   The query will be actively used in the next step, hence it must be mutable</li> <li><code>app.world_mut()</code> denotes that we need mutable (i.e. read and write)   access to the <code>World</code> structure of a Bevy <code>App</code>. Unsurprisingly,   the <code>World</code> structure holds all things that are part of the world   in your game.</li> <li><code>.query::&lt;&amp;Player&gt;()</code> reads as '(from a world, ) get all the players'.   To be precise: we queried the Bevy world for all entities of the <code>Player</code> <code>Component</code>. We will explain entities and components   later; for now, the code <code>Player</code> is related to a   component (whatever that is) for a player.</li> <li><code>query.iter(app.world())</code> reads as 'iterate over the   answers of our question (applied to our -now immutable!- world)'</li> <li><code>.len()</code> is for counting the amount of players that are found</li> </ul> <p>The Bevy <code>Query</code> is the workhorse for reading and writing to your game world and it is very flexible: you'll see many queries in different forms in this book.</p> <p>As querying in Bevy requires the <code>App</code> to be mutable, the <code>App</code> used in the tests needs to be mutable too.

The thoughts are unorganized, and haven\u2019t had the chance to finish reading the book.</p> <p>But I thought early feedback is better than late.</p> <p>Introduction:</p> <p>I believe the focus of 100 percent coverage is not a good reason for TDD. Aiming for 100 percent is an ok goal yet it is unachievable (Eg You cant have test coverage on main.)</p> <p>Edgardo has a point here: 100% code coverage is not always possible. I've changed this:</p> <p>[...] always aiming for 100% code coverage whenever possible.</p> <p>Done!</p> <p>A better reason for adopting TDD is to give developers the confidence that their changes work. As a byproduct of this newly found confidence, developers deliver value to customers at a high pace with minimal bugs. High quality product is the customers value for TDD; and high confidence, and easy of adding new features is the value to the developer.</p> <p>Pressing a button that tells you that its ok to deploy the new changes to your users confidently, this is what truly is all about.</p> <p>Edgardo has a point here: the goal of TDD is indeed not a high code coverage. I've changed the paragraph to state it way my personal goal of the book.</p> <ul> <li>[ ] Check if indeed 100% code coverage is not mentioned as a goal,   like Eduardo states here</li> </ul> <p>2.3.1 The reason app has to be mutable is because of the update method.</p> <p>Changed to:</p> <p>'The Bevy library, however, has good reasons why <code>App</code> must be mutable: also reading data need to be done in a safe way.'</p> <p>I feel mentioning the 'update' method does not help the reader</p> <p>2.3.2 Might benefit to remove the return and semicolon in the implementation to keep consistent the rustacian ways. Maybe you can take the opportunity to teach about the blue phase, refactoring, after making the test pass. I think it would be valuable to show new TDD devs what phase we are at either red, green or blue. Color coding each section to get that rhythm of fail, pass, clean up.</p> <p>I corrected the code: Eduardo is right. I wonder why clippy did not fix this, I guess because it is a test function ...</p> <p>Color-coding sections seems like a fun idea. I try it out.</p> <ul> <li>[x] Consider color-coding sections</li> </ul> <p>I've added it to two sections to see how it feels.</p> <p>2.3.4 I dont like the fact that we just wrote a test that now will fail by modifying the create app to add a player. I would create a new test that create app doesn\u2019t create a player, and another test where we test where we add the new add player system and test it does.</p> <p>An alternative is to initially test that it has a player from the start, and work toward making it pass, and refactor step to make it into its own system \u201cadd_player\u201d. A concept I think this section is missing is that when you are going from red to green you write only enough code to make the test pass.</p> <p>When some is as experienced as us doing TDD we might skip these micro steps but for someone just learning I would suggest breaking those down even further.</p> <p>Agreed, I've added more smaller tests!</p> <p>Blimey, the <code>count_n_players</code> function is not even mentioned!</p> <p>I feel that using create_app function to test individual systems will be hard to maintain our test. I suggest separating the app creation and systems under different test cases. The create app should just create the app, not very valuable tbh. The test to check if it crashes might be a better candidate for end to end test instead of an unit test. Thinking more about this I think first testing a system is more straightforward that testing the if the app crashes or not.</p> <p>For this, I simply don't know how to implement 'separating the app creation and systems'. Maybe that explains why we disagree on the usefulness of the <code>create_app</code> function. I agree with 'testing a system is more straightforward that testing the if the app crashes or not', but -again- I don't know how to create a system...</p> <p>2.4.1 As I feared, create app is doing too much and by adding a feature of adding player sprite it forces us to change a lot of signatures of test that where using create_app.</p> <p>I think the reviewer misunderstood that this chapter starts from scratch again. I've made this more clear in the chapter's text.</p> <p>An idea would be to create a empty app on each test and add the system under test, and only those systems to keep test easier to maintain. Testing create app where it adds all systems will be hard to maintain, especially when systems that depend on third party plugins</p> <p>I feel here again, I am unsure what the reviewer means by creating a system.</p> <p>2.4.3 I think it\u2019s wasteful to add a test that just passes without any change requirements of the production code. Maybe im mistaken but the count_n_players should already be implemented. I guess what you mean is that the call signature if create app has to be modified here.  i would suggest rethinking this section. It seem lazy when you say I will not repeat myself here but maybe im missing something.</p> <p>I think the reviewer misunderstood that this chapter starts from scratch again. I've made this more clear in the chapter's text.</p> <p>2.4.5 An important concept when doing TDD is to write only enough production (non-test code) to pass the test. In this section I think you are writing more than needed to pass the test. Eg the test don\u2019t care about sprite or its transform yet in this section you are writing the code for it.</p> <p>I agree that at the same time the world get a player added, that player also is directly set at the correct location. This correct location 'hitchhiked' with adding the player. The reviewer is right that it should have been done in smaller steps. I've added this to the FAQ.</p> <p>However, maybe I can simplify the setup ...</p> <p>Having given it some thoughts, I actually enjoy to go from big to small, so I keep it.</p> <p>I see now that you add the test for transorm afterwards which is ok when you are experienced, but for a new TDDer you need to break thibgs down in really small steps:</p> <ul> <li>write a list of possible tests</li> <li>pick an easy test</li> <li>write a failing test</li> <li>write enough production code to make it pass</li> <li>clean up removing duplications/refactoring</li> </ul> <p>I believe your audience (new to tdd) would benefit of this breaking down of small steps.</p> <p>I agree that I should split up in more tests, will work on this now.</p> <p>Thanks for the feedback!</p>"},{"location":"introduction/introduction/","title":"1.
