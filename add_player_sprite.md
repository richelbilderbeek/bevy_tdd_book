# Add player sprite

This chapter shows how to add a player sprite to a game.

The [main.rs](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/bevy_tdd_book_add_player_sprite/blob/master/src/main.rs))
is identical to the [main.rs](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/bevy_tdd_book_hello_world/blob/master/src/main.rs))
used in a 'Hello world' program.
See [the 'Hello world' chapter](hello_world.md)
for a more in-depth explanation of 'main.rs'.

The action takes place in [app.rs](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/bevy_tdd_book_add_player_sprite/blob/master/src/app.rs).

## First test


## First fix


## Conclusion

We can now create an `App` with one player sprite,
where the player has, among others, a position and a texture.
When running the `App`, we can see the player. 
However, we do have tested everything that the App does!
